          Pepsi, one of the world's most renowned beverage brands, has a rich and fascinating history. It all began in 1893 when Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist from North Carolina, introduced "Brad's Drink" as a digestive aid. Later renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, the soda gained popularity for its refreshing taste and carbonation. Over the years, Pepsi underwent various ownership changes and marketing strategies, but it wasn't until the 1950s that it emerged as a major competitor to its rival, Coca-Cola. Pepsi's iconic "Pepsi Generation" campaign in the 1960s captured the spirit of youthful exuberance and resonated with the changing cultural landscape. The brand continued to innovate and expand its product offerings, introducing Diet Pepsi in the 1960s and Pepsi Max in 1993. Today, Pepsi is a global beverage leader, offering a wide range of carbonated and non-carbonated drinks, and its distinctive logo is recognized worldwide, symbolizing refreshment, energy, and a zest for life..</p>
